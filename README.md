# TweetMate
TweetMate is a web app that allows users to search for and perform sentiment analysis on recent tweets. This serves as an accessory to Twitter and helps enhance the information we can gather from tweets. I know that there are many other Twitter sentiment analysis projects out there but I wanted to build my own as an academic exercise at AngelHack SV 2015. I finished about 3/4 of the project at the hackathon then completed and deployed it 3 days later.
